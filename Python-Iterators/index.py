#Create an Iterator
# To create an object/class as an iterator you have to implement the methods __iter__() and __next__() to your object.
# As you have learned in the Python Classes/Objects chapter, all classes have a function called __init__(), which allows you to do some initializing when the object is being created.
# The __iter__() method acts similar, you can do operations (initializing etc.), but must always return the iterator object itself.
# The __next__() method also allows you to do operations, and must return the next item in the sequence.


# Iterator vs Iterable
# Lists, tuples, dictionaries, and sets are all iterable objects. They are iterable containers which you can get an iterator from.

# Looping Through an Iterator
# We can also use a for loop to iterate through an iterable object:

# Example
# Iterate the values of a tuple:

mytuple = ("apple", "banana", "cherry")

for x in mytuple:
  print(x)
  

# Exampl
# Create an iterator that returns numbers, starting with 1, and each sequence will increase by one (returning 1,2,3,4,5 etc.):
class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    x = self.a
    self.a += 1
    return x

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)

print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))
print(next(myiter))


# Example
# Stop after 20 iterations:

class MyNumbers:
  def __iter__(self):
    self.a = 1
    return self

  def __next__(self):
    if self.a <= 20:
      x = self.a
      self.a += 1
      return x
    else:
      raise StopIteration

myclass = MyNumbers()
myiter = iter(myclass)

for x in myiter:
  print(x)
